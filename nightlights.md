# During COVID-19 lockdowns night lights in central business districts decreased <!--{ as="img" mode="hero" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurodatacube/eodash/c59adc7d580c6ced1f85a44c5bdd18bf94b3c9ee/app/public/data/story-images/13-nightlights.jpg" }-->

The High Definition Nightlights dataset is processed to eliminate light sources like moonlight reflectance and other interferences. The darker shades are places with less light while the lighter shades of yellow are areas with more light.

High-resolution nighttime images from space, referred to by NASA as the Black Marble HD dataset, provide data on how coronavirus-containment strategies have affected local businesses and neighborhoods. The nightlights sensor can decipher changes in urban business, industry, and transportation activity patterns associated with closures, event cancellations, and reduced vehicle traffic.

#### Nighlights in the Port of Dunkirk, France
observation: **March 2019**

The Port of Dunkirk is the third-largest maritime port in northern France. Located on the busy North Sea, the port is well known for the comings and goings of heavy cargo barges. In early March, following French government guidance, the port began to limit activity in response to the novel coronavirus.

#### Nighlights in the Port of Dunkirk, France
observation: **April 2020**

Researchers are using night lights to track variations in energy use, migration, and transportation at the port in response to social distancing and lockdown measures.

They are able to visualize the extent social distancing measures impacted various economic activities based on whether light pollution increased or decreased, which highways were shut down, and which cities stayed the same.

#### Tokyo, Japan
observation: **April 2019**

In the vibrant city of Tokyo, while some areas seemingly remain unchanged, others revealed a decrease in lights at night. Japan’s virus state of emergency is significantly looser than lockdowns elsewhere in the world. It largely calls for more people to work from home and for bars and restaurants to shut from 8 p.m. In December, amid COVID-19 surge, the city has urged restaurants and bars to shut early, and a new state of emergency putting the upcoming Olympics at stake.

#### Tokyo, Japan
observation: **December 2019**

Dimmer lights during December’s state of emergency were most noticeable in the surroundings of the central Tokyo. As example, Shibuya City a major commercial and finance center, housing the two busiest railway stations in the world, shown in some areas decreasing light due to the imposed closing hours. However, overall change in lights are not so obvious in most parts, as bars for instance are too small and difficult to detect using monthly averaged data.

## Suomi-NPP Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)

Suomi pioneered the generation of satellite products providing global measurement of nocturnal visible and near-infrared light. The high-resolution nighttime images from space, referred to by NASA as the Black Marble HD dataset, is processed to eliminate light sources like moonlight reflectance and other interferences. Furthermore, before assuming the direct link between decrease of lights and COVID-19-related restrictions it is always important to discard other potential factors for change. Nevertheless, this data can shed a light (pun intended) on how coronavirus-containment strategies have affected local businesses and neighborhoods, deciphering changes in urban business, industry, and transportation activity patterns associated with closures, event cancellations, and reduced vehicle traffic by night.
