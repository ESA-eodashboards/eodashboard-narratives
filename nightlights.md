## Satellites Track Phytoplankton’s Algal Blooms and its Impact on Tourism and Fisheries

Phytoplankton, microscopic plants that live in the ocean and inland waters, are responsible for most of the transfer of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the ocean. Carbon dioxide is consumed during photosynthesis, and the carbon is incorporated in the phytoplankton, just as carbon is stored in the leaves of a tree on land. This is called primary productivity, and much like on land, in the ocean and inland waters it is fundamental to feeding other organisms, and generating most of the oxygen we breathe.

However, there are different types of phytoplankton, and some can be less beneficial for the ecosystem than others. Many people who live along the coast are familiar with harmful algal blooms (HAB), also known as red tides. These dangerous conditions occur when certain species of phytoplankton increase rapidly, resulting in damaging effects to other organisms. For example, they can suffocate marine life when they grow too fast. Some HAB-forming organisms produce toxins that affect sea life and humans, causing respiratory problems for those on land close to the water where they form.

Global warming and environmental pollution have led to a rise in the number and severity of HAB outbreaks, which can occur in seawater and fresh water around the world. For example, Florida experiences HABs in its coastal waters and in inland lakes, such as Lake Okeechobee. HAB outbreaks are now even happening in the Arctic, because of warming ocean conditions. Scientists are discovering that some HAB species survive well under increased CO2 concentrations and warmer temperatures, which could indicate more HABs in the future.

Satellites are an effective and important tool to detect, study, and observe changes in HABs, helping us to understand how and 
why they occur.

In Lake Erie in North America (see next page), satellite imagery from a European Space Agency (ESA) satellite sensor shows how the area affected by blooms has increased. These increases in frequency have been related to human activity, such as agriculture practices, which may increase the amount of nutrients in natural waters, creating an imbalance that may favor HAB. Similarly, global warming may cause increases in water temperature that may create conditions that negatively affect non-HAB forming phytoplankton, but benefit HAB-forming species.

It is important to be able to identify and predict blooms. Industries like tourism and fisheries, as well as local health officials can prepare better to mitigate the effect of a HAB. For example, oyster fisheries can close before oysters get contaminated. Municipalities can mobilize resources ahead of time to clean up beaches where a HAB is expected to cause large fish kills.

Satellite data and models can be combined with water samples to identify and eventually predict HAB occurrences to help us understand why they happen and to mitigate the effects.
