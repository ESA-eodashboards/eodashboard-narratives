## Following the Activity of Phytoplankton – The Miracle Plants in The Ocean

When most of us think of plants, we envision the vibrant colors of a beautiful garden, a lush rainforest, or even a healthy bowl of salad. Plants provide us with essential nutrients, and they are critical to maintaining carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels in the atmosphere and regulating Earth’s climate.

Just as important to sustaining life on land, however, are plants in the oceans, which have been studied with advanced satellites and monitoring instruments for more than 30 years.

Before satellite sensors, we thought the open ocean was plain and lacking any significant features. For many years, we depended on measurements taken only from oceanographic ships, but these were laborious and only covered a tiny portion of the ocean at a given time. With a daily focus on the entire Earth, satellite images have revealed a view of the ocean that is as rich and complex as that of land.

About half of the oxygen we take in every breath comes from microscopic plants in the ocean called phytoplankton. Similar to land-based plants, phytoplankton are at the base of the food chain, and they release oxygen during photosynthesis – a process in which energy from the sun is used to convert CO<sub>2</sub> into carbon that is used for growth. Phytoplankton come in different shapes and sizes, and different species have different roles in the ocean ecosystem.

As with land vegetation, there are areas of the ocean where phytoplankton are in abundance and other areas where phytoplankton are scarce. One big difference, however, is that phytoplankton are much more difficult to see than a tree in a forest. Satellites give scientists the data to find and measure the amounts of phytoplankton, and to determine ocean primary productivity, which measures the mass of carbon per area of the ocean over time (mg C m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>).

## Plants and the Climate

Primary productivity is important to the Earth’s environment, notably by capturing large amounts of the CO<sub>2</sub> released from the burning of fossil fuels, which causes global warming. In fact, it is estimated that oceans have captured about half of the CO<sub>2</sub> released by burning fossil fuels.

The Net Primary Productivity (NPP), also known as the net carbon gain by plants, or the measure of plant growth, can be measured via satellite. NASA, JAXA, and ESA base their estimates on slightly different input datasets and methodologies *(Behrenfeld et al. 2005, Kameda et al, 2005; Kulk et al, 2021)*. Nevertheless, all three agencies provide comparable NPP estimates, as highlighted in Fig. 1 which shows maps of global NPP in 2020.

All three NPP estimates also show phytoplankton variability between locations (Fig. 1) and seasons (Fig. 2). This is because phytoplankton primary productivity is affected by conditions in the water column, including temperature, light, and nutrients which, in turn, are themselves influenced by variations in oceanic and atmospheric processes at different spatial and temporal scales.

For example, coastal areas have high levels of phytoplankton productivity due to nutrient-rich waters. These nutrients are brought into the water column by river runoff or coastal upwelling of deep water. Productivity in tropical water is low throughout the year due to warm and highly stratified surface waters that prevent the nutrient-rich deep waters from reaching the surface.

At mid-latitudes, a seasonal cycle is observed, with the lowest productivity in winter due to light scarcity, followed in spring by productivity blooms due to the combination of light and well mixed, nutrient-rich water. In the summer, productivity declines despite strong light availability, due to increased stratification and nutrient depletion by the spring/early summer phytoplankton blooms.

At high latitudes, stratification is weak year-round, but scarcity or absence of light in winter/autumn leads to lower levels of productivity. In spring and summer, similarly to temperate areas, a higher level of productivity is observed due to the combination of sunlight and nutrient abundance. Measuring primary productivity in our oceans is critical to understanding the effects of global warming, now and for the next generation. Our research satellites allow us to do this from the advantageous position of space.
