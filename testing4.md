## Introduction

* United Nations has projected a global population about 8.5 billion in 2030
* Rice, wheat, and maize are the three leading food crops in the world with harvested areas leaders for wheat, rice and maize with 214, 154, and 140 million hectares 
* Agricultural on the Asia rice are remarkably highest in the world and continue to increase 
* Thailand is ranking in the second exporting countries and rice is the largest planting area 61.537 million rai in 2024 (OAE, 2025). 
* Accurate agricultural data is vital for the government in terms of agricultural policy planning, market management, food security, and harmonized with the driven of agricultural digital technology
 * Our group seeking the potential of Geo-Informatics (GI) technology especially remote sensing on crop monitoring and yield estimation. Crop growth model is challenges technique for assimilation data
