## Why storytelling?

Storytelling is crucial in the realm of science because scientific data, while rich in information, can often be complex and challenging to communicate. By framing data within narratives, storytelling makes scientific concepts accessible, engaging, and memorable to a wider audience. It bridges the gap between the technical details of research and the public's understanding, fostering appreciation, curiosity, and ultimately, a deeper connection to the wonders of science.
