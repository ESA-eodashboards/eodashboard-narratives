## Recent melting and darkening of the Greenland Ice Sheet
 
The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is the second biggest ice body on the Earth. GrIS has about 10% freshwater on the Earth â€“ its mass is equal to about eight meters sea level rise. In recent years, the GrIS mass has been lost rapidly. Under global warming conditions, the air temperature rise affects ice sheet melting. The Arctic region is particularly warming due to the Arctic Amplification, and the temperature rise around Greenland is no exception. This air temperature rise has resulted in frequent surface melting of GrIS. For example, in July 2012, approximately 97% of the ice sheet surface melted in Greenland. Since then, the GrIS has experienced several widespread surface melting.

## What exactly happens when surface melting occurs?

First, the snow grain size covering the entire GrIS increases due to wet snow metamorphism. This causes the near-infrared albedo to decrease in the surface of the ice sheet. In other words, the GrIS is darkening in a way that is invisible to the human eye.

## How is the edge of the ice sheet?

At the edge of the ice sheet, the altitude is lower and the air temperature is higher than inland. Therefore, the seasonal snow cover is reduced due to surface melting, the bare ice body at the bottom is exposed. Since bare ice is darker than snow, the albedo of the ice sheet also decreases as the exposed bare ice area expands. Furthermore, prolonged surface melting provides a stable supply of liquid water. The presence of liquid water is known to allow glacial microorganisms to grow on ice surfaces. Glacial microorganisms are adapted to low-temperature environments such as snow and ice surfaces. They are distributed over a wide area of mountain snow gorges, glaciers, and ice sheets, and are known to darken snow and ice surfaces due to their colour pigments. In the same way, they cause "darkening" of large areas of bare ice surfaces during the summer melting season in the GrIS. Especially in the southwestern part of the ice sheet, it is known that a "dark region" appears, in which darkened ice spreads over a wide area in the form of a belt, contributing significantly to the decrease in albedo at the margins of the GrIS.

Thus, the darkening of ice sheets is accelerated by surface melting. As the ice sheet surface darkens, solar radiation absorption is increased. As a result, the ice sheet melts more and more. Monitoring of surface melting of the ice sheet is very important to detect a signal of global warming and a trigger of its mass loss.

## What satellites can do?

JAXA has been monitoring the surface conditions of the GrIS, including surface melting, using a combination of microwave radiometer and optical thermal/infrared observations from various satellites (JASMES Greenland Monitor*). As shown above, surface conditions such as melt, bare ice and dark ice exposure are key components in the ice sheet surface radiative balance and their relationship is now investigated through wide and continuous monitoring by satellite observations. It is important to evaluate the dynamics of polar ice sheets to understand the GrIS mass balance and their impacts on the global environment.
