## Aerosols and clouds belong together

Some clouds would not exist without aerosols, tiny particles that act as nuclei for cloud droplet formation. As air parcels rise through the troposphere, they cool, carrying water vapor that condenses around hygroscopic aerosol particles once temperatures drop enough. These particles, called Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN), enable liquid cloud droplets to form.

Some aerosols help form ice crystals instead, acting as Ice **Nucleating Particles (INPs)**, common at higher, colder altitudes. Depending on whether droplets are liquid, ice, or both, clouds are classified as liquid, ice, or mixed-phase. Natural aerosols include sea salt, volcanic sulfates, and desert dust, while anthropogenic aerosols arise from pollution and biomass burning. Because aerosols influence droplet formation, they also affect cloud structure and behavior. For instance, more CCNs create numerous smaller droplets, increasing cloud reflectivity: **the Twomey effect**. By altering droplet number, phase, and thickness, aerosols modify how clouds reflect sunlight and trap heat, playing a key role in how clouds either amplify or mitigate global warming.

## Challenge
We cannot continuously sample cloud droplets and aerosols directly within clouds, so researchers use several remote methods to study them. You might wonder: how did we understand clouds before satellites, and how can satellites detect such tiny particles?

Our first tool was and remains theory. Physics helps predict how clouds behave and interact with aerosols. Over time, scientists developed equations to describe these processes, later enhanced by computational models that simulate thousands of atmospheric equations. Though simplified, these models reveal valuable insights into cloud–aerosol interactions. To verify models, we rely on observations. In the lab, scientists study ice crystal growth or simulate clouds in controlled conditions. Aircraft equipped with specialized instruments can collect samples and measure properties in real time, but these missions are costly and limited. Satellites, on the other hand, provide continuous, global coverage that complements models, lab work, and field campaigns. Together, these tools offer a more complete picture of this complex system, helping us improve weather and climate predictions in a warming world.


## Objective

The objective of this study is to explore whether and how aerosols influence cloud characteristics: specifically the distribution of liquid water and ice content, at various altitudes using EarthCare’s vertical profiling capabilities. To this end, **EarthCare, a new Earth Explorer from ESA**, was used to identifying patterns in cloud-aerosol interactions across different regions and conditions (e.g. land vs. ocean, tropical vs. polar environments), and determining whether increased CCN or INP concentrations correlate with observable changes in cloud composition.

#### Why EarthCare? 

EarthCARE is a first-of-its-kind mission that offers an unlikely opportunity to understand the complexity of cloud changes using a single satellite. What makes EarthCARE special is its four instruments working together to study clouds, aerosols, and radiation in detail.


* **ATLID (Atmospheric Lidar)** uses laser pulses to detect aerosols and thin cloud layers by measuring how light scatters back from particles, providing high-resolution profiles that improve on previous lidar missions like CALIPSO.
* **CPR (Cloud Profiling Radar)** can "see" across the clouds with radar signals to measure their vertical structure and water content, adding the capability to  capture cloud motion and the speed of precipitation. This imporves the previous mission called CloudSat .
* **MSI (Multi-Spectral Imager)** delivers multi-wavelength images in 7 different bands that reveal cloud structure and aerosol distribution over large areas, complementing MODIS with higher spatial resolution. 
* **BBR (Broadband Radiometer)** measures solar and thermal radiation reflected and emitted by Earth, enabling direct estimates of top-of-atmosphere radiative effects and energy balance. 

Together, these instruments provide comprehensive and blended data that will help us explore interactions and uncover new insights into how clouds and aerosols influence climate.

## Use cases
We decided to take a look at clouds and aerosols at three different locations with quite special characteristics. The first region lies just north of the Equator and stretches west to east across the Pacific Ocean. It's called the call the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and it is characterized by persistent clouds with high and icy tops. The second region is in Antartica, the southern ocean. Here the conditions are quite different and clouds are lower, but because of the temperature these are mostly made of ice:
* **1. West Pacific:**  The western ITCZ is very interesting because air raises in very strong updrafts (air moving upwards), mostly because the sea serface temperature is usually high. These updrafts and the clouds can form storms that can stir the ocean, lifting sea salt aerosols into the atmosphere. These are natural aerosols. However, nearby regions such as Southeast Asia and China may contribute anthropogenic aerosols, from pollution or biomass burning.

* **2.  Eastern Pacific:**  This region typically experiences downdrafts, where air sinks rather than rises. Yet, high clouds still form here. Being far from major population centers and bordered by the Andes to the east, we expect fewer aerosol sources, except perhaps some sea salt.

* **3.  Southern Ocean:** This region presents a different scenario. Aerosols from higher latitudes may influence cloud formation here. We mostly expect sea salt aerosols, but there could also be stratospheric aerosols, especially from volcanic eruptions.

Comparing these three very interesting regions with quite distinctive characteristics could give us a hint on whether the aerosols are influencing changes in the clouds.
