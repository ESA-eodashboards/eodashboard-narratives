## Aerosols and clouds belong together

Some clouds would not exist without aerosols, tiny particles that act as nuclei for cloud droplet formation. As air parcels rise through the troposphere, they cool, carrying water vapor that condenses around hygroscopic aerosol particles once temperatures drop enough. These particles, called Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN), enable liquid cloud droplets to form.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Ice_Nucleation_Mechanisms.png?20141019054030" width="600" style="display:block; margin:auto;"/> <p style="text-align:center;"><b>Figure 1.</b> Various ice nucleation mechanisms in the atmosphere or modes of ice formation in clouds..</p>
Some aerosols help form ice crystals instead, acting as Ice **Nucleating Particles (INPs)**, common at higher, colder altitudes. Depending on whether droplets are liquid, ice, or both, clouds are classified as liquid, ice, or mixed-phase. Natural aerosols include sea salt, volcanic sulfates, and desert dust, while anthropogenic aerosols arise from pollution and biomass burning. Because aerosols influence droplet formation, they also affect cloud structure and behavior. For instance, more CCNs create numerous smaller droplets, increasing cloud reflectivity: **the Twomey effect**. By altering droplet number, phase, and thickness, aerosols modify how clouds reflect sunlight and trap heat, playing a key role in how clouds either amplify or mitigate global warming.

## Challenge
We cannot continuously sample cloud droplets and aerosols directly within clouds, so researchers use several remote methods to study them. You might wonder: how did we understand clouds before satellites, and how can satellites detect such tiny particles?

Our first tool was and remains theory. Physics helps predict how clouds behave and interact with aerosols. Over time, scientists developed equations to describe these processes, later enhanced by computational models that simulate thousands of atmospheric equations. Though simplified, these models reveal valuable insights into cloud–aerosol interactions. To verify models, we rely on observations. In the lab, scientists study ice crystal growth or simulate clouds in controlled conditions. Aircraft equipped with specialized instruments can collect samples and measure properties in real time, but these missions are costly and limited. Satellites, on the other hand, provide continuous, global coverage that complements models, lab work, and field campaigns. Together, these tools offer a more complete picture of this complex system, helping us improve weather and climate predictions in a warming world.


## Objective

The objective of this study is to explore whether and how aerosols influence cloud characteristics: specifically the distribution of liquid water and ice content, at various altitudes using EarthCare’s vertical profiling capabilities. To this end, **EarthCare, a new Earth Explorer from ESA**, was used to identifying patterns in cloud-aerosol interactions across different regions and conditions (e.g. land vs. ocean, tropical vs. polar environments), and determining whether increased CCN or INP concentrations correlate with observable changes in cloud composition.

#### Why EarthCare? 

EarthCARE is a first-of-its-kind mission that offers an unlikely opportunity to understand the complexity of cloud changes using a single satellite. What makes EarthCARE special is its four instruments working together to study clouds, aerosols, and radiation in detail.


* **ATLID (Atmospheric Lidar)** uses laser pulses to detect aerosols and thin cloud layers by measuring how light scatters back from particles, providing high-resolution profiles that improve on previous lidar missions like CALIPSO.
* **CPR (Cloud Profiling Radar)** can "see" across the clouds with radar signals to measure their vertical structure and water content, adding the capability to  capture cloud motion and the speed of precipitation. This imporves the previous mission called CloudSat .
* **MSI (Multi-Spectral Imager)** delivers multi-wavelength images in 7 different bands that reveal cloud structure and aerosol distribution over large areas, complementing MODIS with higher spatial resolution. 
* **BBR (Broadband Radiometer)** measures solar and thermal radiation reflected and emitted by Earth, enabling direct estimates of top-of-atmosphere radiative effects and energy balance. 

Together, these instruments provide comprehensive and blended data that will help us explore interactions and uncover new insights into how clouds and aerosols influence climate.

## Use cases
We decided to take a look at clouds and aerosols at three different locations with quite special characteristics. The first region lies just north of the Equator and stretches west to east across the Pacific Ocean. It's called the call the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and it is characterized by persistent clouds with high and icy tops. The second region is in Antartica, the southern ocean. Here the conditions are quite different and clouds are lower, but because of the temperature these are mostly made of ice:
* **1. West Pacific:**  The western ITCZ is very interesting because air raises in very strong updrafts (air moving upwards), mostly because the sea serface temperature is usually high. These updrafts and the clouds can form storms that can stir the ocean, lifting sea salt aerosols into the atmosphere. These are natural aerosols. However, nearby regions such as Southeast Asia and China may contribute anthropogenic aerosols, from pollution or biomass burning.

* **2.  Eastern Pacific:**  This region typically experiences downdrafts, where air sinks rather than rises. Yet, high clouds still form here. Being far from major population centers and bordered by the Andes to the east, we expect fewer aerosol sources, except perhaps some sea salt.

* **3.  Southern Ocean:** This region presents a different scenario. Aerosols from higher latitudes may influence cloud formation here. We mostly expect sea salt aerosols, but there could also be stratospheric aerosols, especially from volcanic eruptions.

Comparing these three very interesting regions with quite distinctive characteristics could give us a hint on whether the aerosols are influencing changes in the clouds.

    </p>
</div>

#### Dataset
The analysis used three primary EarthCARE data products:

- **CPR_CLD_2A**: Cloud variables including Liquid Water Path (LWP) and Ice Water Path (IWP), plus land/ocean flags
- **ATL_ALD_2A**: Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) at 355nm from lidar measurements
- **AC_TC_2A**: Synergistic radar-lidar target classification distinguishing cloud types and aerosol layers

Data coverage: Approximately 600-700 scenes from June-July and September 2025 (limited by early mission data availability). Analysis was conducted using the Multi-Mission Algorithm and Analysis Platform (MAAP).

#### Methodology workflow

The analysis followed a systematic processing pipeline:

**1. Data Extraction and Preparation**
- Extracted all available data for West Pacific, East Pacific, and Southern Ocean regions (~600-700 scenes)
- Identified land/ocean surfaces using CPR flags

**2. Temporal Resampling and Integration**
- Resampled data to 1-second temporal resolution
- Merged radar, lidar, and synergetic products at 1-meter temporal definition
- Combined AOT, LWP, IWP, and target classification into unified dataset
- Further resampled to 1-minute temporal resolution for analysis

**3. Data Filtering and Normalization**
- Selected only months with complete data availability: June-July and September 2025
- Normalized variables using min-max scaling: (x - min)/(max - min)
- Separated ocean and land observations (dataset predominantly oceanic)

**4. Clustering Analysis**
- Applied K-means clustering to identify natural groupings in aerosol-cloud relationships
- Variables used: Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT), Liquid Water Path (LWP), Ice Water Path (IWP)
- Tested multiple cluster numbers (k=5 shown in results) to understand centroid distances and variable relationships
- Analyzed cluster spatial distribution and vertical structure

## Results

#### Cluster Identification in Tropical Pacific

K-means clustering revealed five distinct aerosol-cloud regimes in the West and East Pacific regions. The clusters show clear separation in the three-dimensional space defined by AOT, LWP, and IWP, indicating distinct physical relationships between aerosol loading and cloud water content.

    </p>
</div>

**Key findings from Pacific analysis:**

- **West Pacific** shows higher aerosol loading clusters associated with increased liquid water content, consistent with CCN enhancement effects from biomass burning and pollution
- **East Pacific** exhibits cleaner marine clusters with lower AOT but still showing varied cloud water content, suggesting natural aerosol influences
- Distinct cluster separation indicates robust relationships between aerosol properties and cloud microphysics

#### Vertical Structure Analysis

Analysis of cluster distribution with height reveals important vertical patterns in aerosol-cloud interactions. Different clusters dominate at different atmospheric levels, reflecting the vertical structure of aerosol layers and cloud types.

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; margin: 40px 0;">
    <img 
        src="https://github.com/eurodatacube/eodash-assets/blob/main/stories/ScienceHub-Challenge-September-2025/Team-1/vertical_clusters.png?raw=true"

        alt="Vertical cluster distribution"
    />
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 10px;">
        <b>Figure 6.</b> Vertical distribution of K-means clusters in West Pacific showing altitude-dependent aerosol-cloud regimes from surface to upper troposphere.
    </p>
</div>

The vertical profiles show transitions between cluster types at different height levels (2.5km, 5km, 7.5km, 10km, 12.5km, 15km, 17.5km, 20km), indicating that aerosol-cloud interactions vary significantly with temperature and atmospheric conditions.

#### Spatial Patterns

Examination of cluster spatial distribution reveals longitudinal patterns, despite latitude and longitude not being included in the clustering variables. This emergent spatial structure suggests that aerosol-cloud regimes are geographically organized, likely reflecting regional patterns in aerosol sources and meteorological conditions.

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; margin: 40px 0;">
    <img 
        src="https://github.com/eurodatacube/eodash-assets/blob/main/stories/ScienceHub-Challenge-September-2025/Team-1/spatial_distribution.png?raw=true"

        <b>Figure 7.</b> Spatial distribution of clusters showing longitudinal patterns in aerosol-cloud regimes across the Pacific.
    </p>
</div>

The presence of spatial patterns emerging from purely microphysical variables validates the physical basis of the clustering but also suggests that more complete temporal coverage will strengthen pattern detection.

#### Antarctica Results

Preliminary analysis of the Southern Ocean and Antarctica region shows distinct cluster characteristics compared to tropical regions, reflecting the unique aerosol and cloud environment of polar regions. The pristine conditions with minimal anthropogenic aerosols provide important context for understanding natural aerosol-cloud interactions.

## Conclusions

This study demonstrates the capability of EarthCARE's integrated sensor suite to reveal relationships between aerosol properties and cloud microphysics across different climate regions. Key findings include:

1. **Robust aerosol-cloud regimes identified**: K-means clustering successfully separated five distinct regimes based on AOT, LWP, and IWP relationships
2. **Regional differences**: West Pacific shows high-aerosol regimes with enhanced liquid water, while East Pacific exhibits cleaner marine conditions
3. **Vertical structure**: Aerosol-cloud interactions vary systematically with altitude, reflecting changes in temperature and cloud phase
4. **Emergent spatial patterns**: Geographic organization of clusters suggests regional coherence in aerosol sources and meteorological controls

The analysis confirms laboratory and modeling predictions that increased CCN availability relates to changes in cloud droplet populations, though the relationship between aerosols and ice content requires further investigation with longer time series.

**Limitations and future work:**
- Limited temporal coverage (June-July, September 2025) restricts seasonal analysis
- Integration challenges between MSI and active sensors (CPR, ATLID) remain
- Target classification integration with clusters needs refinement

**Next steps include:**
- Extending analysis to longer time periods as more EarthCARE data becomes available
- Incorporating full vertical profiles and MSI swath coverage
- Relating clusters to specific target classifications (cloud types, aerosol layers)
- Developing question-driven strategies for integrating categorical classifications
- Including additional study regions and seasonal variations

The framework established here provides a foundation for systematic investigation of aerosol-cloud interactions using EarthCARE's unique observational capabilities, with important implications for climate model validation and weather prediction.
