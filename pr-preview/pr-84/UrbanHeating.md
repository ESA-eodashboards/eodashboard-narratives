## Rising Heat Waves
#### Recent record-breaking: Southern Europe case
Across the globe, and increasingly in Europe, heat waves are becoming more frequent and intense. June 2025 was the third warmest June on record globally, as reported in the latest Climate Bulletin by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) [1](https://climate.copernicus.eu/western-europe-and-mediterranean-gripped-major-heatwaves-june#:~:text=Two%20major%20heatwaves%20led%20to,impact%20more%20people%20across%20Europe.%E2%80%9D&text=The%20average%20temperature%20over%20European,air%20circulation%20out%20of%20Antarctica.). Major heatwaves led to very strong **heat stress** in large parts of western and southern Europe. Cities like Madrid, Rome, and Lyon facing consecutive days above 42°C. This was the hottest June ever recorded in Europe, surpassing long-standing records. Several cities exceeded 44°C, pushing the limits of heat tolerance for both human populations and infrastructure.

These prolonged periods of excessive heat have significant implications for **public health, infrastructure, and urban planning**. The [Paris Agreement](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/paris-agreement-climate/) calls for urgent adaptation strategies to protect vulnerable populations from the worsening impacts of a warming climate. The latest European heatwave underscores the urgency of these actions.

#### Heat stress and green spaces
In urban areas like Paris, where surface temperatures can reach up to 60°C on asphalt, the risk of **heat stress is compounded by the lack of green spaces and high-density building structures**.
Heat stress doesn’t affect everyone equally. In urban environments, socio-economic factors heavily influence vulnerability. Children, the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, and communities in low-income neighborhoods are disproportionately affected by extreme heat events. The 2025 heatwave brought this inequality into sharp focus, with hospitals in Southern Europe reporting a surge in heatstroke and dehydration cases [[2]](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/18/italian-hospitals-report-rise-in-heat-cases-as-rome-hits-41-point-8c)[[3]](https://phys.org/news/2025-06-cold-climate-southern-europe.html), particularly among those in vulnerable communities who had limited access to cooling facilities.

## Understanding Urban Heat Stress
#### Heat and Human Inequality 20-year long study: The case of Houston
A recent study [[4]](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GH001079)  explored the **impact of urban growth and climate change on heat stress in Houston**, Texas, focusing on heat inequalities influenced by socioeconomic and geographic factors. Satellite data, including land cover and vegetation measurements from NASA's MODIS sensor, helped analyze the urban heat island effect, revealing how urbanization and increased surface temperatures exacerbate heat-related health risks. 
The research also integrates population vulnerability data from the CDC to better understand the social dimensions of heat stress in urban populations. In Houston, structural inequalities and patterns of urban development intensify these risks. Social vulnerability indices from the CDC highlight communities where race, income, and access to resources intersect with heightened exposure to heat stress. These are often the **same areas with limited green space and increased infrastructure development, creating urban heat islands**. NASA Earth observations have been instrumental in understanding how Houston’s urban landscape has evolved over the past two decades.

#### The case of the growing city of Houston 
Between 2001 and 2019, satellite-derived land cover maps reveal a significant expansion—over 20%—of urban and built-up land. This growth, concentrated in the city’s southwest, directly **correlates with rising Land Surface Temperature (LST)**.

Leveraging data from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) platform, the study delved into Houston’s changing landscape over two decades by **examining multi-decadal changes both LST and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)**, offering a technical perspective on this urban phenomenon. Terra has been instrumental in capturing this data. This platform, orbiting Earth, scans our planet in multiple spectral bands, allowing for a detailed analysis of LST and NDVI. The decadal periods of 2000-20009 and 2010-2019 were examined specifically to study the growth of Houston's UHI.

#### Land Surface Temperature (LST): 2000
Day and nighttime LST data showed that higher temperatures persist even after the sun sets, exacerbating health risks overnight.  LST is the temperature of the earth’s surface derived from the Terra satellite that houses the MODIS instrumentation, encompassing both natural terrains and man-made infrastructures. Unlike ambient air temperature, which gauges the immediate atmospheric conditions we feel, LST provides a granular temperature profile of surfaces from park greens to asphalt roads. 



The comparison of 2000 vs 2019  in **conjunction with NDVI** gave an idea of the changing access to green space in sprawling urban spaces such as Houston.

## Taking Action: AI applications 
#### Urban Heat Stress Analysis: The Case of Danish Cities   
[CLIM4cities](https://www.linkedin.com/company/clim4cities/) is a European Space Agency-funded project led by the [Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI)](https://www.dmi.dk/) and co-developed with [+ATLANTIC CoLAB](https://colabatlantic.com/). The project focuses on a proof-of-concept application in Danish cities, featuring downscaled short-term predictions and climate change scenarios aimed at supporting local stakeholders in addressing the impacts of extreme heat events through adaptation and mitigation strategies.

As part of the project, advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are being developed to **significantly enhance air and land surface temperature predictions in urban areas for adoption by local actors**. In its initial phase, the CLIM4cities team conducted a series of user needs workshops, engaging citizens, city planners, and other local stakeholders across Denmark to assess and prioritize their needs for the solution. These engagements provide the foundation for ongoing collaboration and future validation of the tools being developed.

On the technical side, the project integrates citizen observations, numerical weather data, and processed Earth Observation (EO) data to build a comprehensive ML database. This database is used to train and test the predictive models, contributing to the development of cost-effective and integrated urban climate services.

Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classifications, derived from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service datasets, were employed to **analyze the impacts of the urban heat island effect in relation to land use and land cover characteristics within cities**. As part of this effort, the consortium is generating high-resolution LCZ baselines, categorized using criteria such as dominant built-up densities, impervious surfaces, tree cover densities, and predominant leaf types.
