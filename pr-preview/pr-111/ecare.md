### From clouds to aerosols<!--{ style="font-size:1.5rem;opacity:0.7;margin-top:1rem;" }-->

## Aerosols and clouds belong together

Some clouds will find it difficult to exist if it wasn't for aerosols. 
Aerosols can act as a nuclei that will help cloud droplets form. 
Parcels of air raises from the surface of the air across the tropospphere, carring water vapour, which is water in gas state. 
As they raise, the temperature drops and they can meet some aerosol particles on the way. Some of these particles are hygroscopic, they blend well with water molecules. At the right cold temperature, water will start condensing around the aerosol particles, changing from gas state to liquid. The particles that serve to activate cloud droples are called cloud condensation Nuclei (CCN). Some other particles will help water molecules to form ice crystals around them, changing to solid state. These woill happen higher in the troposphere or at lower temperatures. These particl;es, which are usually insolluble, are called Ice Nucleting Particles (INPs). Depending on which is the state of the majority of the cloud droplets we can have ice clouds, liquid clouds, or a mix of both.

Because aerosols influence the clouds dropplets since their formation, they can also influence a change in the whole cloud. For example, higher availability of CCNs lead to the formation of more and smaller droplets. In liquid clouds, these make them more reflective to the radiation from the Sun. This is called the Twomey effect. 
Changes in the number of fdroplets that the cloud is mafde of, their physical state, their thickness, can lead to changes in the way they reflect the sunlight or trap the radiation that is reflected by the Earth surface. Understanding these changes is important as clouds can be both an ally or an enemy in the warming effect on the planets surface. 

## How can a satellite help?
Sadly, we cannot pop-up inside a cloud and take a sample of the droplets and aerosols continuouly. However, scientist have developed over the years many ways to have a measure of this. How can a satellite measure the clouds and aerosls, if it's so far away and the particles are so tiny? 

Our first tool, when we didn't have the technology to do it, was the theory. Physics can predict the behaviuor of clouds and their relation with the aerosols. SO over the years we have developed many equations to understand this, in an idealized context.

The more we understood, then the equations began to be more complicated and we tryed to incorporate more realistic thisngs that happen in the atmosphere. Then we had models. COmputational models run a lot of equations that we couln'd do with just pen and paper. These models are still idealized, but help to understand the processes involved and re-deiscover things that we might have missed before. 

How do we know if models are ok? With observations! We have different ways to do this. The first one is in the lab. Many scientist study the grouwth of ice crystals with different aerosols, or create clouds inside a cloud chamber to study their properties. But this is still an ideal environment, and the real atmosphere is more complex. Luckyly, we have airplanes! Yes, with airplanes we can collect pieces of clouds and aerosols, with what is called a probe, and then take them to the lab to analyse them. Of course airplanes have other isntruments that help to measure the general state of the clouds an aerosols from inside. But then, these campaings are very expensive, we can't be flying an airplane all the time across all the Earth. That's why we have satellites! 

All of these things complement each other and we need them to have a better picture of what in reality is very complex and sometimes fast. Having a better understanding will guide us towards having better predictions of the weather and climates, which are essential in a fast-changing and warming world. 

## Our challenge 
We decided to take a look at the aerosols and clouds from EarthCare by comparing 3 different regions. 

The first ones are located in the tropics, in what we call the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone in the Pacific Ocean. 
The Pacific ITCZ is a strip that goes from West to East, a bit northern to the Equator, where characteristic deep convective/ high clouds occurs consistently all the time. 
In the West of this region is very interesting because air raises as very strong updrafts, mostly because the sea serface temperature is usually high. The strong updraft and sometimes storms can produce strong waves and mix, raising sea salt, a non-antropogenic aerosol. The Pacific here is surrounden by east Asia to the south and China to the north, places that could be sources of antropogenic aerosols, for example pollution and mass burn. ref!

We wanted to compare this region to the East Pacific, which under normal condicions is a region of downdrafts, BUT STILL HIGH CLOUDS. Being so far away from populated areas and having the Andes to the East, we were wondering if the aerosls sources are low, exept maybe from some sea salt. 

The third one, quite different, is located in the Southern Sea, nearby Antartica. In the southern ocean, incoming aerosols from higher latitudes could potentially produce changes in the clouds.
We can mostly expect sea salt aerosols in these area, although there might also be some stratospheric aerosols incoming mostly from volcanic eruptions. 

Comparing these three very interesting regions with quite distinctive characteristics could give us a hint on whether the aerosols are influencing changes in the clouds.
