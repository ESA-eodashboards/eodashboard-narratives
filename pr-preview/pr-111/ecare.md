### From clouds to aerosols<!--{ style="font-size:1.5rem;opacity:0.7;margin-top:1rem;" }-->

## Aerosols and clouds belong together

Some clouds will find it difficult to exist if it wasn't for aerosols. 
Aerosols can act as a nuclei that will help cloud droplets form. 
Parcels of air raises from the surface of the air across the tropospphere, carring water vapour, which is water in gas state. 
As they raise, the temperature drops and they can meet some aerosol particles on the way. Some of these particles are hygroscopic, they blend well with water molecules. At the right cold temperature, water will start condensing around the aerosol particles, changing from gas state to liquid. The particles that serve to activate cloud droples are called cloud condensation Nuclei (CCN). Some other particles will help water molecules to form ice crystals around them, changing to solid state. These woill happen higher in the troposphere or at lower temperatures. These particl;es, which are usually insolluble, are called Ice Nucleting Particles (INPs). Depending on which is the state of the majority of the cloud droplets we can have ice clouds, liquid clouds, or a mix of both.

Because aerosols influence the clouds dropplets since their formation, they can also influence a change in the whole cloud. For example, higher availability of CCNs lead to the formation of more and smaller droplets. In liquid clouds, these make them more reflective to the radiation from the Sun. This is called the Twomey effect. 
Changes in the number of fdroplets that the cloud is mafde of, their physical state, their thickness, can lead to changes in the way they reflect the sunlight or trap the radiation that is reflected by the Earth surface. Understanding these changes is important as clouds can be both an ally or an enemy in the warming effect on the planets surface. 

## How can a satellite help?

## Our challenge 
We decided to take a look at the aerosols and clouds from EarthCare by comparing 3 different regions. 

The first ones are located in the tropics, in what we call the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone. 

The third one, quite different, is located in the Southern Sea, nearby Antartica.
