### Using remote sensing data and WASDI workflows to monitor flood evolution in open and urban areas <!--{ style="font-size:1.5rem;opacity:0.7;margin-top:1rem;" }-->

## The 2024 Central European Floods
Throughout much of 2024, numerous European countries were affected by severe floods caused by prolonged heavy rains. Several were catastrophic, causing deaths and widespread damage due to overflowing river basins and landslides.
In response to the floods, the [Copernicus Emergency Management Service](https://mapping.emergency.copernicus.eu/) has been activated to produce detailed maps of the affected areas across several countries, including Poland, Germany, Slovakia, Austria, Germany and Italy.

Emergency response required detailed and timely mapping of the flooded areas. This situation highlighted the critical role of satellite Earth Observation (EO) technologies in monitoring, mapping, and responding to natural disasters.

## Earth Observations of floods
Earth observation (EO) techniques offer the opportunity to monitor and map catastrophic events, providing support that would be impossible to achieve through ground-based observations alone, especially in inaccessible areas after a disaster occurs. Different EO sensors onboard satellite missions allow retrieval of different but complementary information:

* **Optical satellites**, such as Copernicus Sentinel-2, Landsat, and MODIS, capture multispectral imagery that clearly distinguishes water from land, taking advantage of water’s unique spectral signature, which strongly absorbs radiation in the near-infrared and shortwave infrared bands.

* **Radar satellites**, equipped with synthetic aperture radar (SAR), such as Copernicus Sentinel-1, RADARSAT, and TerraSAR-X, operate independently of illumination or cloud cover, allowing monitoring of the surface after flooding events and becoming an indispensable tool for flood mapping.


## The WASDI Platform
**Streamlining flood analysis**

The [WASDI platform](https://www.wasdi.cloud/) represents a significant advancement in EO data processing for flood monitoring. WASDI is a cloud-based workspace designed to simplify access, processing, and analysis of satellite data for environmental applications, including flood management. The method used to produce flood maps over an open area is integrated into an app called [SAR Flood Archive Generator 3.3.4](https://wasdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/WasdiApplications/SARArchiveGenerator.html). This automated application processes the Sentinel-1 GRD
 archive for a specified Area of Interest (AoI), compiling historical flood maps.

The dataset can be acquired via the [Network of Resources (NoR)](https://nor-discover.org/en/news/) request. NoR provides a unique environment for both commercial and non-commercial users to discover, via the NoR Portfolio, a list of European cloud services and estimates of the associated costs to make full use of Earth Observation data. [ESA offers sponsorship](https://nor-discover.org/en/sponsorship/) to eligible entities to cover the costs of trying out these services.

##### Flood Monitoring in Open Areas  
The method used to produce flood maps over open area is integrated in the  [SAR Flood Archive Generator 3.3.4](https://wasdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/WasdiApplications/SARArchiveGenerator.html). This automated application processed the Sentinel-1 GRD archive for the specific area, compiling historical flood maps. The application generates maps for every day for which a Sentinel-1 GRD image is available over the AoI.  Flood detection was performed by analysing intensity values and the output showes flooded (red) and permanent water (blue).

#### Valencia, Spain 
On 29 October 2024, torrential rain caused by an isolated low-pressure area at high levels brought over a year's worth of precipitation to several areas in eastern Spain, including the Valencian Community, Castilla–La Mancha, and Andalusia.

According to Spain’s national weather agency, [Aemet](https://www.aemet.es/en/portada), on 29 October 2024, Valencia received a year’s worth of rain in just eight hours. This deluge caused devastating flash floods, turning streets into rivers, destroying homes, and sweeping away vehicles. The resulting floodwaters caused the deaths of about 232 people, with three more missing[1] and substantial property damage [2][3]. It is one of the deadliest natural disasters in Spanish history [4].

#### Urban Flood Mapping
Concerning urban area, a different method was applied. It relies on the information contained in the phase, rather than the intensity used for open area. Flood is detected analyzing the difference of coherence between a pair of 2 pre-event Sentinel-1 SLC images and a pair of 1 pre-event Sentinel-1 SLC image and 1 post-event Sentinel-1 SLC image. This application, named Urban Flood, available in the WASDI platform, needs as a prerequisite the availability of a building map, to constrain the areas where to look for differences of coherence.

#### St Pölten, Austria
During September 2024, a large weather event affected multiple Central European countries, with Austria's eastern region, including St. Pölten (located in Lower Austria) and Vienna taking a particularly hard hit. The water level of the Wien Riever, in the western part of Vienna rose from 50 centimeters to 2.26 metetrs in the course of a day, leading to the flooding of trails, restaurants, streets and river banks. Electricity was cut off in some districts and subway lines were partially closed as result [5](https://www.dw.com/en/europe-floods-parts-of-vienna-without-power-as-river-rises/live-70220078). The Austrian province surrounding Vienna has been declared a disaster area, with its leaders speaking of "an unprecedented extreme situation" [6](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cdrjjl3mmy8t).

**Extracting furhter information: temporal evolution**
Using WASDI flood maps, it is possible to conduct further analysis and extract further information such as the temporal evolution of the floods. As example,   the total flooded area (red pixels) was estimated for each date by counting flooded pixels and converting them to square meters. By comparing these values over time, the date with the largest flooded area, **2024-09-20** was identified as the most flooded day in the dataset.

#### Relative Flood Risk Map

Based on the **most flooded date** The relative flood risk map shows which roads are most exposed to flooding, based on their proximity to flooded areas. First, the road network around Tulln an der Donau was extracted and converted into a raster grid. Then, the most recent flood map from WASDI was aligned to the same grid. For each road pixel, the distance to the nearest flooded area was calculated. Using an inverse-distance approach, road pixels closer to floods were assigned higher risk scores, while those farther away received lower scores. Finally, these scores were normalized between 0 (low risk) and 1 (high risk) and visualized with a gradient from **green (low risk)** to **dark red (high risk)**, highlighting areas where **flooding can most affect road infrastructure**.

## Open Science
#### Explore Flooding extensions Jupyter Notebooks 
You can further explore an example of WASDI dataset relative to the last example,  the floods over St Pölten, Austria, and gather a further insight over this particular area and event, interacting directly with the dataset though the [notebook below](https://github.com/eurodatacube/notebooks/tree/master/notebooks/curated). 
In this example, the notebook allows to get further insight from WASDI data, which (as some of the examples in this story). The notebook shows how to  overlay flood data on optical imagery (from Copernicus Sentinel-2) allowing for  intuituve **visual interpretation** of the extent and impacts of the floods; the **temporal analysis of floods** and estimation of **flooded areas**, as well as a workflow to generate a **relative road risk flood map**.
