## Challenge

Ocean water types - such as coastal, upwelling, oligotrophic, inland, and eutrophic waters - exhibit **distinct reflectance spectra and bio-optical/biogeochemical characteristics** ([Bi et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.12606)) that reflect different ecological conditions and biological productivity ([Cui et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.02.017); [Uudeberg et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12060931)) features which allows for the distinguishing and grouping different water types. These classifications are fundamental for **understanding marine ecosystems**, **monitoring water quality**, **assessing fisheries health**, **supporting climate research** while unraveling the compelex mechanisms controlling ocean biology, chemistry, and physics. 

Traditional methods for classifying ocean water types rely on **in-situ measurements** (e.g. diffuse attenuation coefficient, water inherent optical properties, and chlorophyll-a concentration) or **supervised classification** requiring extensive labeled training data. However, the spectral signatures captured by satellite sensors contain rich information that can be extensively and easily used to identify natural groupings in ocean properties. **Unsupervised learning approaches**, particularly clustering algorithms, offer a powerful way to discover these patterns directly from Earth observation data without predefined labels.

#### Mediterranean Sea
The Mediterranean Sea represents an exceptional natural laboratory for the study and classification of ocean water types, owing to its **ecological significance** and **considerable economic value**. This semi-enclosed basin is characterized by a high degree of oceanographic complexity, shaped by the interplay of regional climate variability, diverse coastal processes, and intricate basin-scale circulation patterns. Its unique combination of environmental factors makes the Mediterranean an ideal setting for understanding the spatial and temporal variability of water properties and for advancing oceanographic research.

<div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="

**Key motivations for studying the Mediterranean:**

**Fisheries and Biodiversity Management**: Optimizing fish harvesting while preserving fish populations and marine biodiversity requires understanding the distribution and dynamics of different water types that support various marine habitats and food webs.

**Climate Change Monitoring**: Tracking physico-chemical parameters of Mediterranean waters in a changing climate is crucial, particularly considering the basin's contribution to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and its sensitivity to warming trends.


## Data and Methods

## Results

#### Water Type Identification

The clustering analysis successfully identified three primary ocean water types from the eight clusters tested, with distinct biogeochemical and physical characteristics:

**Cluster 1 - Eutrophic Water**:
- Characterized by **colder waters** relative to basin average
- Associated with **eastward winds** driving coastal upwelling
- **Medium chlorophyll-a content** (1-3 mg/m³) indicating elevated productivity
- Typically found in upwelling zones and areas of nutrient enrichment

**Cluster 2 - Coastal Water**:
- Distinguished by **very high chlorophyll-a concentrations** (>3 mg/m³)
- Elevated **sea surface height** in coastal boundary regions
- Represents nutrient-rich waters influenced by terrestrial runoff and coastal processes
- Most productive water type supporting high biological activity

**Cluster 7 - Oligotrophic Water**:
- Dominated by **warmer waters** characteristic of stratified conditions
- Associated with **northward wind and wind stress** patterns
- **Low chlorophyll-a content** (<0.3 mg/m³) indicating nutrient limitation
- Represents the ultra-oligotrophic central Mediterranean basins

    </p>
</div>

**Important finding**: Despite using 8 clusters, the algorithm effectively utilized only 3 distinct clusters, with the remaining clusters either rarely assigned or representing transitional states. This suggests that Mediterranean water types can be meaningfully described by three primary categories, though finer divisions may be needed for specific applications.

#### Spatial Distribution

The spatial distribution of identified water types shows strong geographic coherence aligned with known Mediterranean oceanography:

- **Coastal waters (Cluster 2)** dominate near coastlines, particularly in the Northern Adriatic, Gulf of Lions, and along the North African coast
- **Oligotrophic waters (Cluster 7)** occupy the central basins, especially the eastern Mediterranean
- **Eutrophic waters (Cluster 1)** appear in transitional zones and areas influenced by upwelling or mixing processes


#### Seasonal Variations

Analysis of the seasonal cycle reveals temporal dynamics in water type distribution:

- **Oligotrophic waters (Cluster 7)** show expansion during summer months when stratification is strongest, then contract in winter
- **Eutrophic waters (Cluster 1)** exhibit seasonal variability linked to wind-driven mixing and upwelling events
- **Coastal waters (Cluster 2)** remain relatively stable throughout the year, though this may represent a limitation requiring further investigation

</div>

The seasonal patterns align with known Mediterranean dynamics: winter mixing enriches surface nutrients leading to spring blooms (eutrophic expansion), followed by summer stratification that extends oligotrophic conditions and reduces productivity in open waters.

## Conclusions

This study demonstrates the effectiveness of unsupervised clustering for identifying and mapping ocean water types from multi-parameter satellite observations. Key findings include:

1. **Three distinct water types identified**: Coastal (high productivity), eutrophic (moderate productivity), and oligotrophic (low productivity) waters distinguished by combined biological, physical, and atmospheric characteristics

2. **Geographic coherence**: Spatial patterns align with known Mediterranean oceanography, validating the clustering approach against established understanding

3. **Seasonal dynamics captured**: Temporal analysis reveals expansion/contraction of water types consistent with seasonal stratification and mixing cycles

4. **Multi-parameter synergy**: Integration of chlorophyll-a, SST, sea level height, and wind components provides richer characterization than single-parameter approaches

**Practical applications** include:
- Supporting marine spatial planning and fisheries management by mapping productive zones
- Monitoring ecosystem shifts under climate change scenarios
- Validating biogeochemical models with observationally-derived water type classifications
- Identifying optimal locations for aquaculture or marine protected areas

**Study limitations and future directions:**

1. **Cluster number selection**: Statistical optimum (5 clusters) provided insufficient detail, while chosen number (8) resulted in only 3 active clusters—suggesting need for adaptive cluster selection methods

2. **Coastal water stability**: Lack of seasonal variation in Cluster 2 (coastal waters) may indicate need for higher temporal resolution or separate coastal-specific analysis

3. **Validation needed**: No quantitative validation against in-situ measurements or existing water type classifications was performed

4. **Algorithm exploration**: Testing alternative clustering methods (hierarchical, DBSCAN, Gaussian mixture models) could improve classification

5. **Additional parameters**: Including sea surface salinity, turbidity, or fluorescence line height could enhance water type discrimination

**Future work priorities:**
- Extend analysis to other ocean basins for method generalization
- Incorporate in-situ validation data from research cruises and Argo floats
- Develop operational products for near-real-time water type mapping
- Investigate machine learning approaches for temporal prediction of water type transitions

The framework established here provides a foundation for automated ocean water type classification from Earth observation data, with potential applications in operational oceanography, ecosystem monitoring, and climate change impact assessment.
