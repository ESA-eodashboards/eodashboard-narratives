## 
Mount Etna is the highest active volcano in continental Europe. It has a very long eruptive history that has been going on for over half a million years, but only in the last hundred thousand years has the volcano taken on the conical shape that characterizes it today.

#### SO2 Plume from 2022-02-21 Eruption
Weak Strombolian activity was visible in the late afternoon of 20 February. At 2230 a small lava flow descended a deep notch at the E end of the SEC and traveled towards the Valle de Bove. By 2300 the Strombolian activity had shifted to pulsating lava fountaining. Beginning at 0100 on 21 February more western vents became active and the E vents jetted lava 600-800 m high. Activity intensified at 0128 with jets of lava that rose more than 1 km high and were sustained for about 10 minutes. An eruption plume again rose to 10 km (32,800 ft) a.s.l. Beginning at 0200 the lava fountain became smaller, and at 0220 explosive activity ceased. Lava flowed SW and into the Valle de Bove.

#### SO2 Plume from 2021-06-16 Eruption
INGV reported that there were several episodes of lava fountaining at Etnaâ€™s Southeast Crater (SEC) during 14-23 June, and additional periods of Strombolian activity and ash emissions. The lava fountaining episodes were recorded during 1332-1450 on 16 June, 2220 on 18 June to 0210 on 19 June, 2040-2215 on 19 June, 1131 on 20 June to 0214 on 21 June, overnight during 21-22 June, and in the early hours of 22 and 23 June. Each episode began with Strombolian activity which was followed by lava fountaining and crater overflows sending lava down the flanks. Ash plumes that rose as high as 4.7 km above the summit and sometimes caused ashfall in areas downwind. Lava flows on 16 June descended the SW and SE flanks, and those produced on 21 June traveled about 1 km SW, towards Monte Frumento Supino, and stopped at 2,900 m elevation. The lava fountains on 21 June were notably tall.
