## El Niño 2023–2024
**The 2023–2024 El Niño has peaked as one of the five strongest on record. This story is Part 4 of a series on its global impacts. [Part 1](https://eodashboard.org/story?id=el-nino-extremes) explores rising land surface temperatures, [Part 2](https://eodashboard.org/story?id=sea-surface-temperature-rise) covers sea surface warming and marine heatwaves, and [Part 3](https://eodashboard.org/story/?id=el_nino_part_3_food_security) examines food security disruptions.**
 
Whether you’re a farmer watching the skies, a family navigating flooded roads, or someone checking the weather from thousands of kilometers away, climate extremes affect us all. During the 2023–2024 El Niño, these extremes - heatwaves, storms, floods, and droughts - made headlines around the world.

What we may not see in those headlines is how these events are monitored in near real-time by satellites orbiting high above. Earth Observation (EO) satellites allow us to detect changes in rainfall, monitor floodwaters as they rise, and map storm damage over vast areas. These capabilities are made possible through collaboration among global space agencies - ESA, NASA, JAXA, and others - who make their datasets open for public use.

This story explores the impacts of El Niño in East Africa, one of the regions hardest hit, using the lens of these open EO datasets, which include rainfall maps, flood extents, and river observations.
 


### A Global Climate Driver

El Niño is a climate phenomenon marked by warming sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. These temperature changes alter global atmospheric circulation, disrupting weather systems across continents. The result is often a rise in extreme events, from heatwaves and marine heatwaves to droughts and food insecurity, floods, and powerful storms.
Earth Observation satellites play a vital role in documenting El Niño impacts. Through their optical, radar, infrared, and microwave sensors, satellites reveal what can’t always be seen from eye level: how fast floodwaters rise, where crops fail, or how rainfall changes in real time.
 
## Severe Impacts in the Horn of Africa
**Rainfall Patterns and Climate Drivers**

During the short rains season (October–December) of 2023, East Africa was hit by exceptional rainfall. This was due to the combined effects of El Niño and a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)—another ocean-atmosphere system that enhances rainfall over the region [[1]](https://www.icpac.net/fsnwg/special-report-el-ni%C3%B1o-and-positive-indian-ocean-dipole-to-have-significant-multi-sectoral-impacts-in-east-africa/).

Signs of anomaly were visible in EO data from multiple satellite missions: precipitation far above average levels, changes in vegetation, and swelling river systems. These observations were crucial in tracking the development of the flood season as it unfolded.

### Satellite Observations

By November 2023, heavy rains had triggered deadly flooding across Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Tanzania, displacing over one million people and resulting in more than 350 deaths [[2]]( https://edition.cnn.com/2023/12/04/africa/east-africa-floods-more-than-300-killed-intl/index.html). The floods came on the heels of years of drought, compounding the region’s food insecurity [[3]](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/150712/worst-drought-on-record-parches-horn-of-africa).
In some areas of Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya, rainfall totals were two to four times the seasonal average. This led to major rivers, such as the Shebelle River, overflowing and flooding towns like Beledweyne, Somalia.

#### Beledweyne: image from 26 October 2023 
**Beledweyne** is a city in central Somalia and serves as the **capital of the Hiiraan region**. It holds significant strategic, economic, and cultural importance in the country. The city has a largely agro-pastoral economy, with farming along the riverbanks. Flooding is a recurring issue due to the Shabelle River overflowing, displacing thousands and hindering development of the region.

The Copernicus Sentinel-2 collects data across 13 spectral bands, ranging from visible to shortwave infrared wavelengths. In the image, we are seeing a **true color composite**, since it uses the Red (Band 4), Green (Band 3), and Blue (Band 2) bands—similar to how the **human eye perceives color**. This allows us to view the landscape as it would appear in **real life**.

#### 20 November 2023: Flooded Landscapes of Beledweyne
In November, Beledweyne faced a severe humanitarian crisis triggered by **extensive flooding** on November 12th when rising river water levels led to extensive flooding that engulfed the town. 
This crisis persisted, culminating in a surge of water levels on November 17th due to **heavy rainfall**.

Sentinel-2 captured the scale of flooding. The true color image shows a natural-color view of the flooded region of Beledweyne. 
Areas covered in water appear **dark blue or black**, while vegetation appears green and urban zones appear gray.

#### The impacts of extensive floods 
The flooding is visible where water has overflowed rivers or coastlines, covering fields, roads, and settlements, offering a realistic snapshot of the affected landscape.  

Approximately 85–90% of Beledweyne [was submerged]( https://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/somali-city-of-beledweyne-is-85-under-water-following-devastating-floods/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), rendering large parts of the city underwater. According to the humanitarian group Save the Children, the flooding has forced an estimated [250,000 people](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-11-23/el-nino-worsened-flooding-has-somalia-in-a-state-of-emergency-residents-of-one-town-are-desperate), or 90 per cent of Beledweyne's population, out of their homes.

#### Enhancing flood detection 
A **false color**, also from Sentinel-2,  allows to highlight the contrast between inundated areas and surrounding terrain, .  
In this view, water appears **bright blue, making it easier to identify flood**, aiding to enhanced understanding of the flood extention and detection.

This **false color** image was made using data from Sentinel-2 satellite, combining **green and near-infrared light** (Bands 3 and 8). It uses something called the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), which helps highlight water by comparing how the surface reflects light. In the image, floodwaters appear **in blue**, clearly showing how they’ve spread across the land—especially in flat or farming areas.

 
   



### A Growing Toll

In western Somalia, the Juba River also overtopped its banks, damaging roads and croplands in towns like Luuq and Baardheere, where a key bridge was swept away [[5]](https://www.faoswalim.org/resources/site_files/Somalia_Flood_Advisory_20_November_2023.pdf).
To monitor such conditions, the University of California–Santa Barbara Clim ate Hazards Center uses near-real time analyses and forecasts from NASA’s Goddard Earth Observing System Subseasonal to Seasonal prediction system (GEOS-S2S). This system integrates EO data to track and predict rainfall and soil conditions in regions vulnerable to food insecurity [[6]](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/), [[7]](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/gmao-products/).

In May 2024, new flooding and mudslides struck Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Ethiopia, and Tanzania after five days of torrential rain. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), over 234,000 people were displaced and more than 637,000 were affected [[8]](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/05/1149461), [[9]](https://wmo.int/media/news/flooding-worsens-east-africa).

Flooding in the region also led to secondary impacts. Standing water, damaged sanita tion systems, and blocked roads contributed to outbreaks of waterborne diseases such as cholera, as well as mosquito- and flea-borne diseases including malaria, plague, and Rift Valley fever 
[[10]](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/disease-vector),  [[11]](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/10/return-of-el-nino-raises-risk-of-hunger-drought-and-malaria-scientists-warn), [[12]](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/12/04/africa/east-africa-floods-more-than-300-killed-intl).

## Cyclone Freddy
**A Record Storm Tracked from Space**

Beyond rainfall, El Niño’s effects were also evident in the storm season. One of the most striking examples was Tropical Cyclone Freddy, which broke records for both longevity and impact [[13]](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024GL111964).

EO systems captured its full trajectory and impact using satellite-based precipitation, surface water, and vegetation data—demonstrating the crucial role of global monitoring networks in understanding storm behavior over time.

Freddy made landfall in Madagascar on 21 February 2023, then moved across the Mozambique Channel, where it regained strength and hit Mozambique on 24 February near Vilankulos.

#### 24 February 2023: the Cyclone reaches Mozambique

Though Cyclone Freddy weakened while crossing the island of Madagascar, it regained strength over the Mozambique Channel. On 24 February, it made landfall near Vilankulos as a tropical storm, causing further damage. Cyclone Freddy would go on to traverse the southern Indian Ocean for more than five weeks in February and March 2023, making it the longest-lived cyclone on record.

#### Mapping Flooded Areas with JAXA's ALOS-2 
By using GSMaP data with ALOS-2 data for inundation area estimation, JAXA monitored precipitation and inundated area by Cyclone Freddy.

Unlike optical satellites, ALOS-2 uses **radar, which can see independently of clouds and even at night**. This allows it to capture clear images of flooded areas, even when other satellites are blocked by weather. It's a crucial tool for monitoring floods in real-time, even in poor visibility conditions.

#### Nsanje - a region particularly hard-hit
This caused also severe flooding in Nsanje, a district in southern Malawi, shares a significant portion of its western and southern borders with Mozambique. Tropical Cyclone Freddy caused severe flooding in Nsanje, Malawi, displacing thousands and impacting access to essential services. The cyclone's heavy rainfall and strong winds led to widespread flooding, mudslides, and [damage to infrastructure like roads and bridges](https://reliefweb.int/map/malawi/malawi-tropical-cyclone-freddy-nsanje-district-overview-road-access-flooding-and-location-schools-acting-idp-camps-27-mar-2023).

## Open Science
**Supporting Climate Monitoring**

The ability to monitor floods and storms from space relies on collaboration among space agencies and open access to satellite data. Missions from ESA, NASA, and JAXA provide global datasets that measure rainfall, water extent, soil moisture, and surface conditions—critical for understanding events like those in East Africa.
