## Changing lakes due to human activity

Anthropogenic actions, such as human activities related to agriculture, industry and urbanisation, have significantly impacted inland waters around the world. Sometimes anthropogenic actions work with climate change towards negative impacts.

One major impact of anthropogenic actions is pollution of inland water which can come from agricultural runoff, industrial discharge and urban wastewater. A way to assess water quality is to monitor parameters such as chlorophyll-a concentration, suspended solids and turbidity. Another significant impact of anthropogenic actions on inland waters is habitat destruction and alteration. Deforestation, land use changes and dam construction can alter river flow regimes, disrupt natural habitats, and affect aquatic biodiversity.

The **[turbidity of a lake](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/lwq)** describes water clarity, or whether sunlight can penetrate deeper parts of the lake. Turbidity often varies seasonally, both with the discharge of rivers and growth of phytoplankton (algae and cyanobacteria).

The following map shows the turbidity of Lake Trasimeno (Italy) using the [lake Water quality NRT (near-real-time) product at 300, from the Copernicus Land Service](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/lwq).

## Lake shrinkage 

#### Anthropogenic overuse as a driving force 

The Aral Sea, once one of the world’s largest inland bodies of water \[1\] located between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, has lost over 90% of its original size. This was believed to due to excessive irrigation for cotton farming and other human activities, resulting in devastating environmental, economic, and health consequences for the region \[2\].

A study from 2007, indicated that the diversion of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers away from the sea, one of the irrigation strategies of the former Soviet Union, led to the loss of 90 % of its fish species and over 250 species of plankton \[3\]

However, a recent study \[4\] that analysed the Aral Sea Basin found that the expansion of cropland - previously believed to be the primary cause of of the sea’s shrinkage - ceased in 2000 \[4\], no longer being the main factor driving the shrinkage of the basin. This long-term study used a spatial and temporal scale approach based on Earth observation and found that the hydrological cycle in the basin had intensified. Specifically, the Aral Sea basin experienced a significant increase in the annual total actual evapotranspiration of 10,13% from 1980 to 2019. The basin plain area saw a significant rise of the total annual evapotranspiration by 37.81% which nearly depleted the water that should have flowed into the Aral sea. This increase in evapotranspiration contributed to the shrinkage of the Aral sea, highlighting the importance of reducing this process and minimising unproductive water losses to protect the sea.

As a result of its drastic shrinking, the Aral Sea also suffered ecological degradation with social and economic impacts \[5\].

One of the main consequences of its shrinkage led to a rise in concentration of salts and minerals of the water. That change in chemistry led to staggering alterations in the lake’s ecology causing significant drops in the Aral Sea’s fish population \[6\]. Besides the loss of habitat and changes in water quality caused by the increased levels of salt and other pollutants in the remaining water, the exposed lakebed also released toxic dust particles affecting the health of local residents \[5, 6\]. Strong winds that blow in this area routinely pick up and deposit tens of thousands of tons of now exposed soil every year. This process has not only contributed to to significant reduction in breathable air quality for nearby habitants, but has also appreciably affected crop yields due to heavily salt-laden particles falling on arable land \[6\].

Today the decline of the basin serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the need for sustainable water management practices and international cooperation \[7\]. The long-term sustainability and stability of the Aral Sea’s ecosystem remains uncertain. The sea has experienced significant ecological shifts and irreversible damage over the years, and it may have crossed tipping points in some aspects. Efforts have been to mitigate the damage caused by the Aral sea crisis, including the construction of dams to restore water levels and improve its ecological health \[8\].
