## West Antarctic Glaciers

Pine Island Glacier and neighboring Thwaites Glacier are two of the main pathways for ice from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet entering the Amundsen Sea. Because of their remote location and often hazardous terrain, only a few researchers have ever made the trip to study these glaciers close-up. The glaciers have an immense impact on the rest of the planet and are closely monitored for their potentially harmful effects on sea levels. Thwaites, one of the fastest-retreating glaciers in Antarctica, is nicknamed the “[Doomsday Glacier](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/05/world/thwaites-doomsday-glacier-sea-level-climate/index.html)”. According to a 2020 estimate from the [International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration](https://thwaitesglacier.org/), four percent of sea level rise directly related to climate change came from Thwaites alone, and a sudden total collapse would raise global sea levels 25 inches more. Collectively, the region contains enough vulnerable ice to raise global sea level by about 1.2 meters (four feet).

Scientists have undertaken a multi-part international project (<https://thwaitesglacier.org/>) to study the vast glacier from all angles. The urgency stems from observations and analyses showing that the amount of ice flowing from Thwaites contributing to sea level rise has doubled in the span of three decades.

## Landsat Observations

Over 20 years of cloud-free level-2 surface reflectance Landsat data (2001-2023) have been acquired over the Thwaites glacier.

The following image pair demonstrates the changes that have occurred since the start of this century. The first image, acquired with the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) on Landsat 7, shows the glacier’s floating ice tongue on December 2, 2001 shortly before it calved Iceberg B-22. The second image, acquired with the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8, shows the glacier on December 28, 2019.

Scientists hypothesize that the glacier could undergo even more dramatic changes in the near future. 

Thwaites Glacier measures 74,000 square miles (or 190,000 square kilometers). 

## 
In 2009, scientists discovered a deep-water channel, funneling warm ocean water to the underside of the glacier. This discovery revealed that melting is occurring faster than previously thought as the underwater base is melting simultaneously with the sides of the glacier. Furthermore, the amount of ice flowing from Thwaites has doubled in the span of the last three decades. Researchers believe the glacier could undergo further dramatic changes in the near future as ocean temperatures rise, causing glaciers in Antarctica to melt at an accelerated pace. This increases the likelihood that the glacier will collapse, potentially in the next few decades. The result of this could be devastating, raising global sea levels by several feet, and instigating substantial flooding in coastal areas around the world, leading to widespread loss of life and property destruction.

## Pine Island Glacier

Pine Island Glacier, at 68,000 square miles or roughly two-thirds the size of the United Kingdom, is one of the largest ice streams in Antarctica, flowing into the Amundsen Sea Embayment in West Antarctica. Large calving events, in which big pieces of ice break off the larger glacier, once occurred at Pine Island every four to six years. Now these events happen almost annually, and the smaller icebergs are breaking into even smaller pieces more rapidly, illustrating the impact the current ocean temperatures have on ice melt. Of particular concern are more large cracks forming farther upstream from the ice front than ever before, including in the middle of the ice shelf, where they have not been previously observed.

> *"What the satellites are showing us is a glacier coming apart at the seams”*, said Ted Scambos, a senior scientist at the University of Colorado. *“Every few years a new area seems to be letting go and accelerating. Like taffy being stretched out, this glacier is being drawn into the ocean."*

More precise measurements beneath the glacier, such as the shapes and slopes of the bedrock, would improve forecasts of its future. Researchers mapping the bedrock have discovered Thwaites Glacier is particularly vulnerable to marine ice-sheet instability because its grounding line (the area of a grounded glacier or ice sheet that meets a floating ice shelf or glacier tongue) is deep below sea level and largely influenced by ocean-driven melting rates happening at the bottom of the glacier. Its bedrock topography recedes into kilometer-deep troughs, which means if the glacier thins enough for the grounded ice to start floating, the grounding line would retreat farther into the ice sheet interior, exposing more ice to ocean-induced melt. Since the ice is thicker inland, grounding line retreat would also result in more ice being transported each year from the grounded ice sheet interior to the ocean, contributing to accelerated sea-level contribution. This process results in a positive feedback loop that represents a major potential for instability in the region. Uncertainties in the bedrock’s appearance under the presently grounded ice make it difficult for models to accurately predict future instability.

Currently, estimates of the glacier’s grounding line retreat vary widely because the data needed to measure its location and movement is incomplete. Measurements of the bedrock’s topography, typically taken by ground and airborne radar, are sparse, resulting in bedrock maps that are too imprecise for the model to make sufficiently accurate predictions. To be accurate enough to capture all the bedrock features that could impact glacier retreat, future measurements will need a horizontal resolution of about 1.25 miles (two kilometers), meaning measurement points on a “grid” over the surface would need to be separated by no more than two kilometers. Vertical resolution accuracy needs to be even more precise at 6.5 feet (eight meters).

While such a catastrophic collapse and resulting sea level rise are a distant future possibility, the current rate of glacier retreat presents immediate dangers to coastal areas that are impacted regularly by even relatively small increases in sea level. As technology advances, scientists will be better equipped to improve bedrock map accuracy, leading to increased confidence in projections of the glaciers’ future as well as anticipated sea level rise.
