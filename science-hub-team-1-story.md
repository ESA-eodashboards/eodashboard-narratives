## Aerosols and clouds belong together

Some clouds would not exist without aerosols, tiny particles that act as nuclei for cloud droplet formation. As air parcels rise through the troposphere, they cool, carrying water vapor that condenses around hygroscopic aerosol particles once temperatures drop enough. These particles, called Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN), enable liquid cloud droplets to form.

Some aerosols help form ice crystals instead, acting as Ice **Nucleating Particles (INPs)**, common at higher, colder altitudes. Depending on whether droplets are liquid, ice, or both, clouds are classified as liquid, ice, or mixed-phase. Natural aerosols include sea salt, volcanic sulfates, and desert dust, while anthropogenic aerosols arise from pollution and biomass burning. Because aerosols influence droplet formation, they also affect cloud structure and behavior. For instance, more CCNs create numerous smaller droplets, increasing cloud reflectivity: **the Twomey effect**. By altering droplet number, phase, and thickness, aerosols modify how clouds reflect sunlight and trap heat, playing a key role in how clouds either amplify or mitigate global warming.

## How can a satellite help?
We can't continuously sample cloud droplets and aerosols directly from within clouds. However, researchers have developed several methods to study them remotely. You might ask: How did we develop understanding of clouds when we didn't have satellites to watch them from avobe and how can a satellite measure aerosols from space, given their small size? Our first tool was and still is the theory. Physics allows us to predict how clouds behave and interact with aerosols. Over time, researchers developed equations to describe these processes under ideal conditions.

As our understanding improved, these equations became more complex, incorporating more realistic features of the atmosphere. The advances in computing led to the development of computational models. These models are simulations that solve thousands of equations to represent atmospheric processes. While still simplified, these models help us explore interactions and uncover new insights. To understand if the models are representing the real-life processes, we rely on observations.
One approach is laboratory experiments. Scientists study how ice crystals grow with different types of aerosols or simulate clouds in controlled chambers. However, lab conditions are still idelized compared to how complex is real atmosphere. Fortunately, we also have airborne measurements. Aircraft equipped with specialized instruments, or probes, collect samples of clouds and aerosols for laboratory analysis and can also measure their properties in real time. However, such field campaigns are expensive and limited in space and time, this is where satellites become essential.Satellites provide continuous, global observations that complement lab experiments, aircraft missions, and models. Together, these tools offer a more complete picture of a complex and changing system, improving our ability to refine weather and climate predictions in a warming world.

### Why EarthCare? 

EarthCARE is a first-of-its-kind mission that offers an unlikely opportunity to understand the complexity of cloud changes using a single satellite. What makes EarthCARE special is its four instruments working together to study clouds, aerosols, and radiation in detail.

ATLID (Atmospheric Lidar) uses laser pulses to detect aerosols and thin cloud layers by measuring how light scatters back from particles, providing high-resolution profiles that improve on previous lidar missions like CALIPSO.
CPR (Cloud Profiling Radar) can "see" across the clouds with radar signals to measure their vertical structure and water content, adding the capability to  capture cloud motion and the speed of precipitation. This imporves the previous mission called CloudSat .
MSI (Multi-Spectral Imager) delivers multi-wavelength images in 7 different bands that reveal cloud structure and aerosol distribution over large areas, complementing MODIS with higher spatial resolution. 
BBR (Broadband Radiometer) measures solar and thermal radiation reflected and emitted by Earth, enabling direct estimates of top-of-atmosphere radiative effects and energy balance. 

Together, these instruments provide comprehensive and blended data that will help us explore interactions and uncover new insights into how clouds and aerosols influence climate.




## Challenge
In the latest ESA challenge workshop, we decided to take a look at clouds and aerosols at three different locations with quite special characteristics. 
The first region lies just north of the Equator and stretches west to east across the Pacific Ocean. It's called the call the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and it is characterized by persistent clouds with high and icy tops. The second region is in Antartica, the southern ocean. Here the conditions are quite different and clouds are lower, but because of the temperature these are mostly made of ice. 








## Objective

The objective of this study is to explore whether and how aerosols influence cloud characteristics—specifically the distribution of liquid water and ice content—at various altitudes using EarthCare’s vertical profiling capabilities. T his involves identifying patterns in cloud-aerosol interactions across different regions and conditions (e.g. land vs. ocean, tropical vs. polar environments), and determining whether increased CCN or INP concentrations correlate with observable changes in cloud composition.

## Use cases
To capture the diversity of aerosol-cloud interactions, this study focuses on three climatically distinct oceanic regions. 
* **1. West Pacific:**  The western ITCZ is very interesting because air raises in very strong updrafts (air moving upwards), mostly because the sea serface temperature is usually high. These updrafts and the clouds can form storms that can stir the ocean, lifting sea salt aerosols into the atmosphere. These are natural aerosols. However, nearby regions such as Southeast Asia and China may contribute anthropogenic aerosols, from pollution or biomass burning.

* **2.  Eastern Pacific:**  This region typically experiences downdrafts, where air sinks rather than rises. Yet, high clouds still form here. Being far from major population centers and bordered by the Andes to the east, we expect fewer aerosol sources, except perhaps some sea salt.

* **3.  Southern Ocean:** This region presents a different scenario. Aerosols from higher latitudes may influence cloud formation here. We mostly expect sea salt aerosols, but there could also be stratospheric aerosols, especially from volcanic eruptions.

Comparing these three very interesting regions with quite distinctive characteristics could give us a hint on whether the aerosols are influencing changes in the clouds.

#### How can EarthCare Helps us?
Five different types of forests were used as case studies to test and compare interpolation methods. Each site represents different forest types, climatic conditions, and seasonal patterns, providing a comprehensive assessment of method performance under real-world variability.
