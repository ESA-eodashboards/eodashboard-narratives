## Research Collaboration on Glaciers and other ice formations

Researchers and scientists across the globe are paying daily attention to two glaciers located in West Antarctica. Thwaites Glacier is a mammoth sheet of ice. It is melting and changing so rapidly that it has been nicknamed [Doomsday Glacier](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=doomsday+glacier&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8).

According to a 2020 estimate from the [International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration](https://thwaitesglacier.org/), four percent of sea level rise directly related to climate change came from Thwaites alone, and a sudden total collapse would raise global sea levels 25 inches more. Pine Island Glacier flows with Thwaites Glacier and collectively, the region contains enough vulnerable ice to raise global sea level by about 1.2 meters (four feet). (The [Copernicus Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Videos/2020/09/Copernicus_Sentinel-6_in_action) satellite launched in 2020 is dedicated to the the precise measurement of sea level. This is a cooperation among European Commission, ESA, Eumetsat, NASA and NOAA, with contribution from the CNES French space agency.)

A change this drastic will affect coastal communities around the globe. For more than a decade, international research efforts have used satellites and instruments to monitor the rapid ice loss to better understand and predict the changes on these glaciers. Since 2018, scientists have undertaken a multi-part international project (<https://thwaitesglacier.org/>) to study the vast glacier from all angles. This research includes exploring the ocean and marine sediments, measuring currents flowing toward the deep ice, and examining the changes of the glaciers.

Researchers at NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) are also keeping a watchful eye on these glaciers and other ice formations that have potential to affect our global climate system. Their observations are below:
