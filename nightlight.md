# Lockdown impacts seen from Space
When COVID-19 swept across the globe in early 2020, life as we knew it came to a halt. Streets emptied, businesses closed, and bustling cities fell silent. But what if we could see these changes from space?
Thanks to satellite technology, we actually can. But we noticed stricking differences across the world.
The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP), a joint mission of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NASA provides global measurements of nigthtime lights. Based on it, a new dataset was developed (by professor Bumpei Tojo - Associate Professor at the Graduate School of Global Studies, Tokyo University of Foreign Studies ) to observe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on socio-economic activities by analyzing variations in nighttime light levels from 2019 to 2022. It was designed to eliminate interference from natural sources such as moonlight and cloud cover, ensuring a clear representation of human-made light sources. The dataset uses varying shades of color to represent different intensities of light; darker shades indicate areas with less artificial light (e.g., rural or undeveloped regions), while lighter shades of yellow signify regions with higher concentrations of light (e.g., cities and industrial zones).

### But what has SUOMI allowed to show?
 
 
A [research from Wuhan Univeristy](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8241690/)  revealed three main patterns in how cities' night-time light (NTL) brightness changed during lockdowns: in some NTL  **reduced (in Asia most pronounced)**, but in Europe there were no significant changes. Some contries showed an increase of NTL, and others presented a diverse/scattered light repsonse. However, most keep somthing in common: **their center unchanded**.

#### Cairo
The uncommon circumstances forced by the lockdown have brought with it many changes in the urban life. After being abandoned for cultural reasons, perceived unsafety, lack of attractive physical qualities and the presence of other more appropriate alternatives, the streets of the neighborhood have regained their vitality and liveability during the lockdown. Many people have referred to the streets as the only alternative for their psychological wellbeing, as well as enhancing their social and physical health.

White color means no change in night light activity.
