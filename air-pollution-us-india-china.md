## Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and Sulfur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)

**A picture diary of air quality in the northeastern regions of India, China, and the United States.**

Air quality levels in the northeastern regions of India, China, and the U.S. are monitored and recorded daily -- all from the watchful eye of one satellite and its instruments, stationed 440 miles above Earth's surface.

As it is with many areas on the globe, the air pollution levels in northeastern India, China and the U.S. have changed significantly over the past two decades, specifically for air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>).

**Sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)** is an air pollutant that leads to acid rain, haze, and many health-related problems. This pollutant is primarily produced through the burning of coal to generate electricity. **Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)** is a gas that is emitted into the air from the burning of fossil fuels. NO<sub>2</sub> is injected into the atmosphere in the emissions from cars, trucks, buses, and power plants.

To better understand how NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> pollution is changing around the world, scientists are using data from the northeastern regions of **India, China, and the U.S**. for several case studies. These studies monitor changes in these pollutants over time and can inform the actions that attempt to clean the air.

Air pollution is now considered the world's largest environmental health threat, accounting for an estimated seven million deaths every year, according to the World Health Organization. Monitoring the gasses that produce air pollution provide data to help identify the sources of these pollutants, and potentially lessen their health impact.

NASA scientists began monitoring and measuring nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) in 2004. The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), stationed on NASA's [Aura satellite](https://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/omi.html), provides a unique insight on gasses such as NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>, as well as aerosols, such as smoke, dust, and sulfates.

Since its launch, OMI data has seen hazardous gas emissions drop significantly in some areas, while rising in others. Scientists are using the images and data collected to better understand the role of human activities in these changes, and which changes occur through natural processes.

## United States


For example, this image shows decreases in SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> in the Ohio River Valley region of the United States. (Note: this website features an interactive tool that allows you to draw a box around areas of interest and see timeseries data for that region). The decreases in the U.S. can be attributed in large part to improved emissions from cars and trucks, as well as a reduction in the sulfur content in fuel. Some improvement is also the result of technology that does a better job of trapping nitrogen and sulfur oxides from power plant smokestacks.

***USA**.   This image shows decreases in SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> in the Ohio River Valley region of the United States. The decreases in the U.S. can be attributed to the improved catalytic converters in cars and trucks and well as a reduction in the sulfur content of fuel that is cleaner than previous years. Some of this improvement is also the result of the implementation of newer technology that does a better job of trapping the nitrogen and sulfur oxides in powerplant smokestacks.*

## China

Satellite observations for northeastern China show a different story. The data for SO<sub>2</sub> (red) show a 90% reduction in this pollutant from 2005-2021. The atmospheric levels of NO<sub>2</sub> initially increased after 2005, then started to decrease after 2011. As of 2021 the atmospheric NO<sub>2</sub> abundance is approximately 20% lower than at the start of the OMI record.

This highlights the different strategies and technologies employed to reduce these two pollutants. While SO<sub>2</sub> primarily comes from coal and diesel fuel, the NO<sub>2</sub> is released by all combustion sources and as a result a bit more difficult to control.

***CHINA.**   The satellite observations for northeastern China show a different year-to-year story. The timeseries for SO<sub>2</sub> (red) shows a 90% reduction in this pollutant, while the atmospheric levels of NO<sub>2</sub> initially increased after 2005 and then started to decrease after 2011. As of 2021 the atmospheric NO<sub>2</sub> abundance is approximately 20% lower than at the start of the OMI record.

## India

The timeseries charts for northeastern India show a steady increase for both NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> from 2005-2018, which then leveled off, perhaps due to the deployment of air pollution control technology. The significant drop in both SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> in 2020 is most likely the result of the prolonged COVID-19 lockdown in India that resulted in a reduction in fossil fuel combustion.

***INDIA**.   The timeseries charts for northeastern India show a steady increase for both NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> from 2005 to 2018. Interestingly, the amount of pollution in this region appears to have leveled off over the past few years, perhaps a sign that air pollution control technology has started to be deployed on large pollution sources. The significant drop in both SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> for 2020 is most likely the result of the prolonged COVID-19 lockdown in India that resulted in a reduction in fossil fuel combustion.*

## Future Research

These observations represent almost two decades of daily air pollution data that show an increasingly clear picture of where the gas comes from and how the amount entering the atmosphere has changed over time and whether changes in air quality control are making a difference.
