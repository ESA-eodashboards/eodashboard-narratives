#  Australian bushfires in 2019-2020 emitted 700 million metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere <!--{ as="img" mode="hero" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurodatacube/eodash/c59adc7d580c6ced1f85a44c5bdd18bf94b3c9ee/app/public/data/story-images/8-wildfires.jpg" }-->
### How Air Pollution affects Climate Change <!--{ style="font-size:1.5rem;opacity:0.7;margin-top:1rem;" }-->

## Air Pollution and Climate Change

Australia’s bushfires in the 2019-2020 season emitted about 700 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Using satellite data, a new study published in Nature proves how satellite measurements can illuminate the complicated ways in which Earth is responding to climate change in an era of worsening wildfires.

Australia is no stranger to bushfires, however, the 2019-2020 season proved to be unprecedented. As of March 2020, the fires burned an estimated 18.6 million hectares (or 186 000 sq km) destroying over 5000 buildings and killing over 400 people. It was estimated that more than a billion animals perished from the bushfires, with several endangered species facing the risk of total extinction.

Based on a new [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03712-y), published in _Nature_, the extreme bushfires across southeast Australia released about 700 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the air – more than double the emissions provided by fire emission inventory datasets.

In southeast Australia, the fires were both intense and extensive. As much as 74 000 sq km of mostly eucalyptus forest, roughly 2.5 times the area of Belgium, was affected. Previous estimates from global inventory datasets of wildfire emissions based on satellite fire data and modelled quantities of standing biomass suggested that the fires released on average 275 million tonnes of carbon dioxide between November 2019 and January 2020.

However, the new analysis indicates that this figure was a gross underestimate. Using measurements from the Tropomi instrument on board the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite more accurate estimates of the emissions were obtained.

  <figcaption>This image uses information from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P mission and shows the average carbon monoxide concentrations from 1 November 2019 to 31 January 2020. Carbon monoxide is commonly associated with traffic, but the concentrations here are due to the bushfires. Naturally, once in the air, it can cause problems for humans by reducing the amount of oxygen that can be transported in the bloodstream.

## Copernicus Sentinel-5p TROPOMI
 
While Tropomi doesn’t directly measure carbon dioxide, the instrument takes daily snapshots of carbon monoxide levels in the atmospheric column beneath it. These data have been used to calculate a detailed estimate of the carbon monoxide emissions from the bushfires, which were then used as a proxy for calculating carbon dioxide emissions.

The conclusion is that the bushfires released about 700 million tonnes in just three months. This is twice the amount of carbon dioxide that had previously been suggested by fire inventory estimates and surpasses Australia’s normal annual bushfire and fossil fuel emissions by 80%.

## Explore Datasets

This **EO Dashboard** provides access to interactive maps of Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, and Sulfur Dioxide from TROPOMI. Access these datasets by clicking on the [Dashboard](https://www.eodashboard.org/explore) button at the top of the page or directly from the links below:

- [TROPOMI CO](https://www.eodashboard.org/explore?indicator=N1_CO)
- [TROPOMI NO2](https://www.eodashboard.org/explore?indicator=N1_NO2)  
- [TROPOMI SO2](https://www.eodashboard.org/explore?indicator=N1_SO2)

The compare feature in the dashboard allows looking at the levels of CO on two different dates or compare two variables on similar dates.
