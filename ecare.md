### From aerosols to clouds <!--{ style="font-size:1.5rem;opacity:0.7;margin-top:1rem;" }-->

## Aerosols and clouds belong together

Some clouds would struggle to exist without aerosols.
Aerosols are made of small particles that can act as nuclei, helping cloud droplets form.
In a simplified way, this works as follows: as parcels of air rise from the Earth's surface through the troposphere (the part of the atmosphere in contact with the surface), they carry water vapor, which is water in its gaseous state. As the air ascends, it cools because the temperature in the troposphere decreases with height. Along the way, it may encounter aerosol particles. Some of these particles are hygroscopic, meaning they attract and interact well with water molecules. When the temperature drops sufficiently, water vapor begins to condense around these particles, forming liquid droplets. These particles that help activate cloud droplets are known as Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN).

Some aerosols are made of particles that will help water molecules form ice crystals, transitioning into a solid state. This typically occurs higher in the troposphere or at colder temperatures. These particles, which are often insoluble, are called Ice Nucleating Particles (INPs). Depending on the state of the majority of droplets, clouds can be classified as liquid, ice, or mixed-phase.

Different types of aerosols are made of different particles. We often distinguish between aerosols derived from human activity (anthropogenic aerosols) and natural aerosols (non-anthropogenic). Examples of natural aerosols include sea salt spray, sulfates from volcanic eruptions, and dust from deserts. Examples of anthropogenic aerosols include those coming from industrial activity, generally pollution, and smoke from biomass burning.

Because aerosols influence cloud droplets from the moment they form, they can also affect the overall structure and behavior of the cloud. For example, a higher concentration of CCNs leads to the formation of more and smaller droplets. In liquid clouds, this increases their reflectivity to sunlight, a phenomenon known as the Twomey effect.
Changes in droplet number, phase (liquid or ice), and cloud thickness can alter how clouds reflect solar radiation or trap heat emitted from the Earth's surface. Understanding these interactions is crucial, as clouds can either mitigate or amplify the warming of the planet.

## How can a satellite help?
We can't continuously sample cloud droplets and aerosols directly from within clouds. However, researchers have developed several methods to study them remotely. You might ask: How did we develop understanding of clouds when we didn't have satellites to watch them from avobe and how can a satellite measure aerosols from space, given their small size? 

Our first tool was and still is the theory. Physics allows us to predict how clouds behave and interact with aerosols. Over time, researchers developed equations to describe these processes under ideal conditions.

As our understanding improved, these equations became more complex, incorporating more realistic features of the atmosphere. The advances in computing led to the development of computational models. These models are simulations that solve thousands of equations to represent atmospheric processes. While still simplified, these models help us explore interactions and uncover new insights.

To understand if the models are representing the real-life processes, we rely on observations.
One approach is laboratory experiments. Scientists study how ice crystals grow with different types of aerosols or simulate clouds in controlled chambers. However, lab conditions are still idelized compared to how complex is real atmosphere.

Fortunately, we also have airborne measurements. Aircraft equipped with specialized instruments, called probes, can collect samples of clouds and aerosols, which are then analyzed in laboratories. These aircraft can also carry sensors to measure cloud and aerosol properties in real time. However, such field campaigns are costly and cannot be conducted everywhere or continuously. This is where satellites become essential.

Satellites provide global, long-term observations that complement lab experiments, aircraft missions, and models. Together, these tools offer a more complete picture of a system that is both complex and rapidly changing. Improving our understanding helps refine weather and climate predictions and is critical in a warming world.

### Why EarthCare? 

EarthCARE is a first-of-its-kind mission that offers an unlikely opportunity to understand the complexity of cloud changes using a single satellite. What makes EarthCARE special is its four instruments working together to study clouds, aerosols, and radiation in detail.

ATLID (Atmospheric Lidar) uses laser pulses to detect aerosols and thin cloud layers by measuring how light scatters back from particles, providing high-resolution profiles that improve on previous lidar missions like CALIPSO.
CPR (Cloud Profiling Radar) can "see" across the clouds with radar signals to measure their vertical structure and water content, adding the capability to  capture cloud motion and the speed of precipitation. This imporves the previous mission called CloudSat .
MSI (Multi-Spectral Imager) delivers multi-wavelength images in 7 different bands that reveal cloud structure and aerosol distribution over large areas, complementing MODIS with higher spatial resolution. 
BBR (Broadband Radiometer) measures solar and thermal radiation reflected and emitted by Earth, enabling direct estimates of top-of-atmosphere radiative effects and energy balance. 

Together, these instruments provide comprehensive and blended data that will help us explore interactions and uncover new insights into how clouds and aerosols influence climate.

## Our challenge 
In the latest ESA challenge workshop, we decided to take a look at clouds and aerosols at three different locations with quite special characteristics. 
The first region lies just north of the Equator and stretches west to east across the Pacific Ocean. It's called the call the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and it is characterized by persistent clouds with high and icy tops. The second region is in Antartica, the southern ocean. Here the conditions are quite different and clouds are lower, but because of the temperature these are mostly made of ice. 

1. West Pacific: 
The western ITCZ is very interesting because air raises in very strong updrafts (air moving upwards), mostly because the sea serface temperature is usually high. These updrafts and the clouds can form storms that can stir the ocean, lifting sea salt aerosols into the atmosphere. These are natural aerosols. However, nearby regions such as Southeast Asia and China may contribute anthropogenic aerosols, from pollution or biomass burning.

2.  Eastern Pacific:  This region typically experiences downdrafts, where air sinks rather than rises. Yet, high clouds still form here. Being far from major population centers and bordered by the Andes to the east, we expect fewer aerosol sources, except perhaps some sea salt.

3.  Southern Ocean: This region presents a different scenario. Aerosols from higher latitudes may influence cloud formation here. We mostly expect sea salt aerosols, but there could also be stratospheric aerosols, especially from volcanic eruptions.

Comparing these three very interesting regions with quite distinctive characteristics could give us a hint on whether the aerosols are influencing changes in the clouds.
