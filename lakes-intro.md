# Impacts of climate on inland water

Inland surface water habitats are non-coastal above-ground open fresh or brackish waterbodies (e.g. rivers, streams, lakes and pools, springs), including their littoral zones [1]. With sustainable management practices, these water resources provide essential services such as food production, flood regulation and water purification [2,3] for the wellbeing of both urban and rural communities. Climate change and anthropogenic actions put multiple pressures on these sources of water, with far-reaching consequences ultimately affecting the health of humans and animals. Satellite remote sensing offers effective ways to monitor these impacts and understand the risks of reaching ‘tipping points’: a critical threshold where a small change in a certain condition can lead to large (and often irreversible) shift in the system. Earth observation satellites from ESA [4-6], NASA [7,8], and JAXA [9] allow scientists to have a clear view on different variables characterising inland water bodies including:


- **Surface water temperature**. This parameter provides valuable information about changes in water temperature over time and can be measured with satellites equipped with thermal infrared radiometer sensors [5,8]. Rising water temperatures can trigger growth and proliferation of harmful algae blooms (HABs); thermal stratification; oxygen depletion (also known as hipoxia) leading ultimately to the collapse of lakes’ ecosystems [10].
- **Water level**. Water level or height can be captured with satellite altimeters [4,11]. Monitoring water level in lakes and reservoirs helps to understand water storage and availability [6, 7]. While in some cases water levels are decreasing due to drought or overuse [e.g. 12], in others, fresh glacial meltwater might lead to higher levels in glacial lakes [13].
    Water surface area is another simple parameter which can be estimated from radar and optical satellite observations through techniques such as image segmentation and classification.
- **Water quality**. There are multiple parameters that can be measured using optical satellites [4,14] including turbidity and chlorophyll concentrations [5, 10] or salinity, using microwave radiometer [15, 16]. These can be used as indicators of ecosystem health and water quality; and their change can be indicative of increased salinisation; sediment runoff, or excessive nutrient pollution, which can have detrimental effects on freshwater ecosystems.

Researchers at NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) are keeping a watchful eye on inland water bodies. Their observations are below:



- [**Climate change impacts on inland water**](https://eodashboard.org/story?id=lakes-climate): Climate change is causing rising temperatures globally, and inland waters are not immune to this trend as shown with satellite imagery. Increasing temperatures can impact inland waters in several ways. In this story we illustrate the effects of evapotranspiration, changing precipitation patterns and extreme events on four inland water bodies in the North America, Europe and Asia.

- [**Observing algae blooms**](https://eodashboard.org/story?id=lakes-algae): This story illustrates observed changes in temperature, ice cover and precipitation the impact algae bloom in two inland water bodies in Northern Europe and South-East Asia

- [**Anthropogenic influences on inland water bodies**](https://eodashboard.org/story?id=lakes-human-activity): This story looks at how human activities related to agriculture, industry and urbanisation, can significantly impact inland waters around the world. With Earth Observations from ESA, NASA and JAXA we illustrate such impacts in water bodies in Europe, North America and Africa.
