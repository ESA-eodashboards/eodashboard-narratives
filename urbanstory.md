 ## Intro
 
 New Delhi, in India, is one of the most densely populated urban centers on Earth. Like many megacities, it faces numerous challenges that threaten the health and well-being of its residents. By combining satellite observations with ground-based and socio-economic data, researchers can track these challenges across key dimensions of urban health. This story shows how the combination of free, open data and tools from three space agencies, ESA, NASA, and JAXA can be used to measure and monitor the cityâ€™s vulnerability to extreme heat, hazardous air, and the cascading risks of life in a megacity under strain.
